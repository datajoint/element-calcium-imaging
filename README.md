# DataJoint Workflow - Functional Calcium Imaging

DataJoint Workflow for functional calcium imaging combines multiple DataJoint Elements to process data acquired with [ScanImage](http://scanimage.vidriotechnologies.com), [Scanbox](https://scanbox.org), `Nikon
NIS`, or `PrairieView` acquisition software, using [Suite2p](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p) or [CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn) analysis software. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

Installation and usage instructions can be found at the
[Element documentation](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-calcium-imaging).
