# Data Pipeline

Each node in the following diagram represents the analysis code in the pipeline and the
corresponding table in the database.  Within the pipeline, Element Calcium Imaging
connects to upstream Elements including Lab, Animal, Session, and Event. For more 
detailed documentation on each table, see the API docs for the respective schemas.

The Element is composed of two main schemas, `scan` and `imaging`.

## Diagrams

### `imaging` module

- Multiple scans are acquired during each session and each scan is processed independently.

### `multi-scan-processing` branch

- The processing pipeline is typically performed on a per-scan basis, however, depending
  on the nature of the research questions, different labs may opt to perform
  processing/segmentation on a concatenated set of data from multiple scans. To this
  end, we have extended the Calcium Imaging Element and provided a design version
  capable of supporting a multi-scan processing scheme.

## Table descriptions

### `lab` schema

- For further details see the [lab schema API docs](https://docs.datajoint.com/elements/element-lab/latest/api/element_lab/lab/)

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |

### `subject` schema

- Although not required, most choose to connect the `Session` table to a `Subject` table.
