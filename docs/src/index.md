# Element Calcium Imaging

DataJoint Element for functional calcium imaging with `ScanImage`, `Scanbox`,
`Nikon NIS`, or `PrairieView` acquisition software and `Suite2p` or `CaImAn` analysis software. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and automate data collection
and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data
storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be combined with
other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.
