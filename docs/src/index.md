# Element Calcium Imaging

DataJoint Element for functional calcium imaging with `ScanImage`, `Scanbox`,
`Nikon NIS`, or `PrairieView` acquisition software and `Suite2p`, `CaImAn`, and
`EXTRACT` analysis software. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and automate
data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular
pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be
combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.
