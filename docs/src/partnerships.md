# Key partnerships

Several labs have developed DataJoint-based data management and processing pipelines for two-photon calcium imaging. Our team collaborated with several of them during their projects. Additionally, we interviewed these teams to understand their experiment workflow, pipeline design, associated tools, and interfaces.

These teams include:

- MICrONS (Andreas Tolias Lab, BCM) - https://github.com/cajal
- BrainCoGS (Princeton) - https://github.com/BrainCOGS
- Moser Group (Kavli Institute/NTNU) - private repository
- Anne Churchland Lab (UCLA)
